<p>How can you help?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>contribute</strong> to this guide -- <a href="https://github.com/morgamic/managerhacking/">fork it on github</a>

</ul><h2>
<a name="what-goes-in-here" class="anchor" href="#what-goes-in-here"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What goes in here?</h2>

<p>Some background on all of this might help you understand where it came from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Right now, each chapter is based on a unique session.  In these hacking sessions, intentionally vague and open-ended questions are presented in order to provoke partitipation and allow folks to relate to the topic.  Initially, this seemed pretty cheesy but it yielded great results.  Many of the answers are already out there, I just listened and wrote them down.</li>
<li>Moving forward, I hope to expand scope.  As other people get involved and the handbook/movement grows, this can take on a life of its own.  What happens is largely up to you.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="thank-you" class="anchor" href="#thank-you"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Thank you</h3>

<p>Thank you for reading this and being interested in helping managers (even if it's just you!).  Your thirst for learning and generally improving things helps make the world a better place.  I salute you.</p>
