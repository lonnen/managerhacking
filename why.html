<h2>Why are you here?</h2>

<h3>What do you wish you knew before you became a manager?</h3>

<h3>What is a bad manager?</h3>

Manager handbook - wish we had one!  Something explaining the 101 stuff would have been useful when we became managers.

Bad managers - lots of interesting discussion about the traits of bad managers.  Might be worth exploring more.

Knowing who to talk to - not everyone knew who to reach out to or who was there to support them as a manager.

Balancing technical ability with management - dealing with doing less coding and knowing when to get out of the way.  What made us great technical contributors does not translate into being a great manager.  How do we deal with that?

How to have difficult conversations - how and when to have the tough conversations was brought up multiple times.

How to develop people - lots of people interested in partnering with people on their team to make progress in their careers and being their coach.
