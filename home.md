# Manager Hacking Runbook

## Overview

Manager Hacking is a movement dedicated to helping you become a better manager.  If you're here, you are a part of the movement.

There is a missing piece in most organizations.  When someone is promoted into management they are not amply prepared for their transition.  Manager Hacking is here to help you:
* supplement other training materials you may have
* help other managers around you, including your own 
* gain perspective by exploring feedback  situations
* encourage managers in different parts of your org to interact and form
